Woke up at 8:30 AM.

-----------------------------------

Instantly struck with anxiety from an unproductive day yesterday.

Woke up in a panic.

Online by 8:45 AM.

Looked at my new TODO list and immediately spaced out.

-----------------------------------

9:30 AM.

-----------------------------------

Morning meeting went well enough.

I didn't have much of an update but I had plenty to talk about still.

-----------------------------------

I got some files generated which is good.

I need to rebuild this process though, it's too slow.

-----------------------------------

Read a bit on how car engines are designed.

History of Ford GT mostly.

Ford V. Ferrari was a lie.

-----------------------------------

What's the premise of The Da Vinci Code?

Was Jesus Christ married?

Stupid.

Or........

-----------------------------------

This reads more like Twitter than a journal.

-----------------------------------

If I made a twitter, this would have been way simpler.
I'd also have mobile support.

-----------------------------------

Fuck, the CME is closed and I never made my phone call.

-----------------------------------

I can do that tomorrow morning before I leave for work.

I'll set a few reminders.

-----------------------------------

Why is this CSV generation process so slow?

-----------------------------------

I read a bit of 1984.
4 sentences.

-----------------------------------

Baseball is on.
If the Yankees aren't playing, the game doesn't count.

-----------------------------------

Bed time 2:35 AM

-----------------------------------
