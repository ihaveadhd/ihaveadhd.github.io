Day 3 on Amphetamine Salts

18 - Oct - 2020

[5 mg amphetamine salts extended release][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall]

Woke up at 10:30 AM.

Hanging out with some high school friends today.

-----------------------------------

Asked Dr. friend what I need to know about drinking on meds.

He laughed boldly as I sipped on an orange juice thing.

I didn't drink much after. lol

-----------------------------------

Spaced out a few times in conversation.

Nothing new.

-----------------------------------

Park after for some puppies and football.

Thank GOD we went to Carl Shurz.
I was exhausted by 6.

My shoulders absolutely done for but I can still drop a 30 yard DIME.

Met a dog name Bo.
Super cute.
He was too young to be at the dog park though.

Shared dog bowls -> kennel cough.

Football.

You're not actually supposed to do sports at Shurz.
Can't get yelled at by a sign.

You can get yelled at by a middle aged woman walking across the ridge that almost gets hit with a football when you try to throw a football over it.

Whoops.

-----------------------------------

Bed time: 2:30 AM.

Work tomorrow.
