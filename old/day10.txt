I forgot where I put this dir.
Thankfully I'm good at naming.

I forgot to write for days 1 - 9.

I'm taking the ADHD Self Assessment thing.
Suggested by the internet (Reddit).

I just got distracted for almost half an hour.
Felt like 5 minutes.

Back to the assessment.

 1. very often
 2. very often
 3. very often
    I'll remember something like a friends getaway or an exciting job
    interview. Dates, day to day things, meetings for work, etc... are
    almost always catching me by surprise.
 4. often
    If it's something that my brain want's me to be working on, it's a bit
    easier. Even then though, it takes days to really start on it. I'll
    try to start thinking about it and then zone out, sometimes for hours.
 5. often
 6. often
 7. very often
 8. very often
 9. very often
10. very often
11. very often
12. sometimes
    I usually force myself to stay in my seat but it's an active thing. I
    have to repeat in my head, "dont stand up." Unfortunately, I wind up
    tuning out whatever the meeting is about.
13. very often
    I usually dread trying to go to bed at a normal time because of it.
    It's driven my sleep pattern way out of whack.
14. very often
15. very often
    When I notice it, I stop talking for extended periods out of shame. It
    has made connecting with dates difficult. I'll talk for an hour and
    then avoid making any noise at all for the next hour.
16. often
    I've gotten better with this but it's an active thing. I have to tell
    myself, while someone is talking, not to interrupt. I wind up not
    listening to whoever is talking most of the time
17. often
    I'll just walk away from whatever the situation is if I can. Otherwise
    I start to get very anxious. If I can find something to zone out on
    that helps a lot.
18. sometimes

Welp...
