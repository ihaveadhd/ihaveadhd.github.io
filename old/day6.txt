Day 6 on Amphetamine Salts

21 - Oct - 2020

[5 mg amphetamine salts extended release][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adderall]

Office day

I'm up at 7 AM

------------------------------------

Almost didn't make it in to the office on time
Had to take a cab so I wasn't late

------------------------------------

Getting ready takes more than 10 minutes
Who would have thought

------------------------------------

Bet the over on herbert this week
He's very good

------------------------------------

Cuz is getting married in 2 days
I hope my suit still fits

I tried in on like 3 days ago but I lost weight since

------------------------------------

How does an adult who is always eating still lose weight?

------------------------------------

CCNA book is super boring but I'm breeeeeezing through it

------------------------------------

I wonder how expensive a good NYC bike is
Skateboards are terrible transportation

------------------------------------

I may get a coffee maker for the apartment
I don't know if I would use it though

------------------------------------

Where's my power drill?

------------------------------------

11:45

LUNCH

SO HUNGRY

(my office buys us lunch when we're in)

------------------------------------

12:30

Nap time?

I wish

------------------------------------

Just zoned out for like 10 minutes

------------------------------------

Got some work done
Not a lot but it got done

------------------------------------

I've been more productive today helping other people
do their work than doing my own

That's pretty normal tbh

------------------------------------

I need a hair cut
Too late to get one before the wedding

------------------------------------

Alex needs a favor after work

I either have to help him move something heavy or he got a car

------------------------------------

Probably going to have to move something heavy

------------------------------------

I hope 10 mg works

------------------------------------

CEH studying

------------------------------------

It's 2:35 PM, do you know where your children are?

------------------------------------

I forgot about some chili I had in the fridge

I need to throw that out when I get home

------------------------------------

It's not 5 PM

What the hell happened?

------------------------------------

7 PM

Just got home

Alex got a car lol

------------------------------------

He didn't even give me a ride all the way home

------------------------------------

Movie time

------------------------------------

Hackers: 10/10

A masterpiece

------------------------------------

Spaced out half way through and bounced between reddit, insta, and the walls

------------------------------------

12:45 AM: Bed

------------------------------------
