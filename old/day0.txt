# Day 0

No adderall.

I have to get it after work.

Was very scattered today.

Almost missed my appointment wist Constantine.

Sick.

Appointment went well though, so that's good.

----------------------------------------------

Work. We're in the office today.

Spent the morning talking with Ariel about tech and shit.
It's always good to catch up when we get to actually be in the office.

I forgot to put my lunch order in.
I was reading about how security policies are established in large companies.
Our junior on OneBook put my order in for me though.
He can stay.

----------------------------------------------

Post lunch

I managed to get focused enough to rebuild the maystreet parser.

The abstraction is coming along, all I need now is a parallel processing approach.
Sync processing is so slow.

Got distracted immediately after with a code review and thinking about Mr. Robot.

-----------------------------------------------

Drinks after work

I was spaced out for like 90% of it.

Some thinking, mostly just starting at the ground.

-----------------------------------------------

Managed to get to CVS to pick up the script.

50 bucks?
Not bad.
I can find a pharamcy that takes my insurance though.

Amphetamine Salts?

Jeeze.

I got a lot of weird looks from the junior pharmacist.

------------------------------------------------

Home

I build a miniature processing pool protocol.
It took like 20 minutes after thinking about it all day.
No idea if it works though.

My heads racing though.
