I have an appointment set up with Hello Ahead.

I'm going to jot down my symptoms so I don't forget to mention things.

- My mind is always racing
- I always have multiple projects going at once
- I can rarely finish a project
- I work in 10 minutes bursts of HYPER productivity between hours of zoning out
- I forget everything
- I have to set dozens of alarms to remind myself
- I'm chronically late
- Sporadic productivity has gotten me in trouble at work before
- I can't sleep
- I misplace or lose everything that isn't tied to me
- I can't hold a conversation for more than 10-15 minutes
- I can only do things that my brain feels like doing
    Most of my decisions can be described as impulsive or hasty
    I usually jump then look type of thing
    I but in to conversations and then feel like crap and try to stay quiet for a while
- My room is a fucking mess right now
- I usually flip a coin to make decisions. If I give myself time to think about it, I'll forget
- I used to have problems controlling my temper and emotions. I still have problems controlling my temper and emotions
    This one also sucks in particular because I'm a big dude and I look pretty intimidating, especially to women. When I start to get angry
    I excuse myself from wherever I am to hide it from anyone so that I don't scare them.
- I eat a ton
- I'm very hard on myself and rarely find things about me that I like
- I usually have to iterate on my work with someone else to make sure I catch all of the requirements and edge cases
    If I don't, I wind up missing a ton of use cases for our back-office teams and trading desks
- When I was a kid, I struggled to succeed in school because of homework
    I hid a lot of it because I'm smart-ish but once I got into more advanced details in topics, I'd lose it
    Almost failed out of my math program because of that
    I would just get distracted from homework or studying and then all of a sudden it's 3 AM and I need to try to sleep
- I almost got fired from a great job because I struggled to work during typical office hours
- I speak very loudly which is apparently a possible symptom? I thought it was an Italian thing


When I was a kid, my teachers told my parents that I had ADD/ADHD (late 90's/early 00's, age 5-10)
My parents chalked it up to 'hes just an active boy'
I think I could always get by as above average because I'm smart but I've always struggled reaching full potential on anything
I just couldn't keep myself comitted
I've ruined every relationship I've been in because I was always so 'out there' and 'up and down'
Smoking cigs helped but I wound up smoking a pack a day just to keep myself feeling normal

I don't want to have ADHD.
I want to get my life on track.
I have ideas and things that I want to build.
